# EatsNDrinks - Project 1

Mobile & Desktop Appication that allows users to search browse and save Multiple food and adult beverage recipes with the click of a button.

# Concept

•Allows users to search, browse and save food and beverage recipes
•Due to Covid-19 people are asked to stay home and avoid restaurants. We hope to bring the restaurant to them!
•As a “Social Distancer” I WANT to have access to food and drink recipes so THAT I can make dinner and a cocktail at home.

# Process
•Technologies Used - HTML, CSS, Javascript, Pure.CSS, Jquery, Local Storage
•Break Down of Tasks and Roles – Christopher and Roland worked on the CSS.    Chris, Winston and Femi worked on Javascript.
•Challenges -  Getting the load more button to function within a for loop. Styling things being pulled in from API's at random sizes and values
•Successes - finding simple solutions to problems we had been overcomplicating. Becoming familiar with Github
